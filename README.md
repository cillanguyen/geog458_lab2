### Purpose

For this research, I have chosen to focus on the most popular drinks currently consumed by people, namely milk tea and matcha.

### Reason

I embarked on this comparison to explore potential similarities in the vocabulary associated with these drinks. My aim was to analyze common words and understand the reasons behind their prevalence.

### Comparison

Upon examining both word clouds, I observed several shared words such as tea, make, and recipes. It appears that there is a significant emphasis on recipes for preparing these drinks. However, there are differences; matcha's vocabulary includes words like easy, simple, and go, while milk tea features words like time, cook, and boba. This distinction arises from the time-consuming nature of milk tea preparation compared to the simplicity of matcha, which requires only three ingredients.

### Reason for the Outcome

The distinct nature of the two drinks contributes to the observed differences. One requires more ingredients, including the preparation of boba, while the other is simpler and requires fewer components.

### Future

To enhance my research in the future, I could delve deeper into the time required for each drink's preparation. This would allow for a more accurate assessment of whether the word cloud aligns with the actual characteristics of each drink, considering that not all milk tea variations involve the inclusion of boba.

### Anything unexpected?

The word cloud effectively condensed the anticipated results for each drink. However, an interesting observation in the matcha word cloud was the prevalence of the word "more." While it's uncertain what this specifically signifies about matcha, it adds an element of curiosity to the analysis.
