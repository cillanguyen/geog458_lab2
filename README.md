- Please create a narrative based on your research. In your narrative, please describe
the topic as well as the parameters you have used for search (5 PTS)

For this research I have decided to do it based on the most popular drinks that people
are currently drinking which is milk tea and matcha.

- why do you want to make this comparison (5 PTS)

I wanted to make this comparison because I wanted to explore the similar vocabs
that these drinks might have in similar. I wanted to analyze any vocabs that they
both have and why might that be.

- compare the word clouds and discuss the difference or similarity among the word clouds (5 PTS)

While looking at both word clouds I have notice a few words that both word clouds have
and that is tea, make and recipes. It seems like there is alot of recipes on how to
make these drinks. A differences is matcha has more vocabs containing easy, simple
and go. While milk tea have time, cook and boba. This is probably because milk tea is
time consuming, while matcha is easy since it only required 3 items to make the drink.

- what might be the possible reasons for the patterns you observed (5 PTS)

The reason is the two drinks are quite different from each other. One requires
more items while the other don't require that much items. And in order to make
milk tea you would need to make boba as well.

- how your research could be improved in the future (5 PTS)

My research can be improved in the future if I looked further into which drink
take the most time and compare it to further identity if the word cloud is right.
Because not all milk tea requires boba.

- anything you find from the map or data that is different from your expectation before the exercise, or anything that stands out to you (5 PTS)

The word cloud basically simplified the results that I would have expected
for each of these drinks. If I were to name one thing for the match word cloud
I have noticed that more is one of the word that was found. I don't know if that
really says anything about matcha.
